I am not sure what i want this to be right now, but when i do know...it will be FIERCE.


Somewhat of a Purpose
---------------------

I am initially using this as a way to learn different third party WPF libraries. This repo may end not doing anything more than a hodge podge of different code examples. Here is a list of 'Frameworks' that I am planning to use:

- ReactiveUI (holding off on this for now)
- Caliburn.Micro
- NLog
- MahApps.Metro
- Akavache (Maybe)
- Squirrel (Somehow)
- MEF
